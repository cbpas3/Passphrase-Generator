# Passphrase generator in Python3

## Rationale

In order to make turning phrases into passphrases easier but also safer, this program should be short and readable so no one has to use online converters wherein you can't see what's happening behind the curtain or longer complicated programs that take time and effort to read.

## Use

Create `Input.txt` and enter a phrase to convert on each line. Output will be printed to the terminal.
